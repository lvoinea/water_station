# Water Station
An Arduino-controlled battery-powered robot for giving 
water to plants. 

The system allows pumping water from a reservoir into up to 6 
recipients by moving a mobile arm with a flexible pipe attached
to it. Water is pumped at regular times as specified via a number
of configurable timers. Once the water enters a recipient, it is
delivered to one (or more) plants via another set of pipelines
by the will of the gravity.

A video of the first iteration (MK1) is available
